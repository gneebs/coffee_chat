# coffee_chat

This is a simple chatbot I built as a project in the Codecademy ["Build Chatbots with Python"](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/build-chatbots-with-python) course. The goal of the project was to learn loops, and I created more infinite loops during this project than I care to admit!
